2019 Trek Bicycles Interview Assignment

Background
We asked over 12000 families what Trek bicycles they have in their garage. The responses
were captured at https://trekhiringassignments.blob.core.windows.net/interview/bikes.json.

Instructions
Write an application in Java that uses the captured response data to tell us what the 20 most
popular responses are. Your application should display the top 20 most popular responses
(combinations of bikes) and how many families own that combination.

Please donâ€™t spend more than about 30 minutes on this exercise.

Deliverables
The 1) output of the application and 2) a link to the source code (a GitHub Gist is fine) or you
can zip it up and send it directly to us.
